        // this program is intended to act as a basic calculator for addition or subtraction.

        // the user must input 1 or 2 depending on which function they want the calculator to perform

        // the first number after that would indicate how many numbers excluding itself would be used in the calculation.

        // all the calculations will be at the 2nd decimal place.

        // if the user inputs any other number for the mode, it will ask them to use a different number

        // 1 is addition where all numbers except the first will be added together

        // 2 is subtraction where all numbers except the first number will be subtracting the second number inputed

        // for example:

        // : inputing 1 would set it to addition mode

        //  then the following inputs 2 2 2 would do  2+2 and output 4.00 and display that value

        // inputing 2 sets it to subtraction mode

        // : then 2 2 2 would do 2-2= 0.00 and display that value

        //inputting 3 gives the response "wrong operation" and asks for them to input 1 or 2  till they input a valid mode

        // once the operation is finished the user can respond with Y or y or Yes to perform a new operation, this will continue till they don't input those values.
